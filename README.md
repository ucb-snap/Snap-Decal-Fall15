#Snap! Below the line - Fall 2015 - Final Project

##Debug Block

###Short Description

Our main idea for the final project came from an actual feature request for the Snap! language: add a **Debug Block**.

We will build a block that pauses the execution and gives control the execution flow to the user, allowing features like variable checking and understanding what the code is doing.

This will help students to understand (and fix, if needed) their code with ease.

###Plan

1. Follow the execution flow of the blocks inside the JS files, to get a better understanding of the language
2. Learn how the blocks are structured
3. Learn how to get control over the block execution threads
4. Implement the debug block, which pauses the thread and allow the user to print variables and step through the sub-blocks inside the debug block
