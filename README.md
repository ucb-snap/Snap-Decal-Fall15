# Snap-Final-Project
Creating Variable Number of Inputs for “Or” and “And” Blocks

Project Description



Under the "Operators" section in Snap, there is a block called "join" which joins together the two strings you insert into the two blanks.
You can also extend the join block in order to get more entries to insert more strings. 
We would like to apply this same functionality to the "and" and "or" blocks so that it is more convenient to use them. 
With this functionality, you would never need to nest several “and” or “or” blocks together when you have more than two inputs, and it would be much easier to read your code.




Implementation Plan:

1. Look up where the "join" functionality is described in Snap

2. Understand how this functionality is implemented 

3. Apply this functionality to the "and" and "or" blocks

  -Make sure the “and” and “or” blocks return the correct response with more than 2 inputs
  
  -Add the arrows on the block to control the number of inputs (like the join block)
