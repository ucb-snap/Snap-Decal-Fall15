# Snap--Disable-Tool

EDIT 12/04/2015: Try it out - grab a motion block, right click, select 'disable' and see what happens.

Description of project idea: 
This project will add an "inline comment" functionality to the SNAP! programming language source code through the addition of a 'Disable' button. If the user clicks "disable" the block will turn grey or black and will be skipped when they run the code. Michael and I thought this was a crucial and important feature that would help students using Snap!, especially since this is possible in professional coding languages.

Implementation of project idea:
We will be looking for the files where the code is executed, and add in options for disabling and undoing the disable. This will most likely be the most difficult part. We will also need to look for the file that changes the look of the block so that when the disable button is hit, the block turns grey. Lastly, we need to make sure that users are still able to run their code even after commenting a certain part out.

If somehow we do happen to finish this project with relative ease, Michael and I talked about some other enhancements that we could also do.
